Dialogue: 1,0:00:03.05,0:00:05.45,CHS,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}本教程中我们将展示如何
Dialogue: 2,0:00:03.05,0:00:05.45,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}In this lesson we're going to show how to
Dialogue: 1,0:00:05.84,0:00:10.26,CHS,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}导入给定素材 特别是粒子
Dialogue: 2,0:00:05.84,0:00:10.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}take the content examples that are given specifically the particle example
Dialogue: 1,0:00:10.64,0:00:15.62,CHS,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}
Dialogue: 2,0:00:10.64,0:00:15.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and maybe add it to a project that basically already exist.
Dialogue: 1,0:00:15.82,0:00:18.77,CHS,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}
Dialogue: 2,0:00:15.82,0:00:18.77,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So then we can take the particles and we can view them in the scene.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:19.42,0:00:25.22,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So to get started, I've already download the Game SDK sample project that shown right here,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:25.48,0:00:27.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and it shows that it's installed.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.20,0:00:34.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So the first thing we need to do is actually target this project at where it resides.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:34.80,0:00:38.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So we're gonna reveal in the explorer, if I bring that up, we can see
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.84,0:00:41.96,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}that this project actually resides in the C root
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.20,0:00:45.42,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}CRYENGINE Launcher\Crytek\GameSDK_5.0
Dialogue: 0,0:00:45.56,0:00:48.00,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and then this is your actual game folder.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:48.38,0:00:50.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So to take a previous to project,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:50.84,0:00:52.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}what we're gonna do is step back,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.66,0:00:55.46,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and we're going to click Add Existing project.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.04,0:00:58.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}Once we click this, we'll get a little prompt
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.32,0:01:00.42,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and it allows us to browse for the folder.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:00.64,0:01:03.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}If you remember we said that it was in the C root,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:03.44,0:01:09.14,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}so if we go in here, we can see that we have CRYENGINE Launcher\Crytek\GameSDK_5.0,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:09.32,0:01:11.80,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and then GameSDK is what we want to target.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:12.28,0:01:16.98,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We're gonna click OK, and now we have added an existing project, it's all new.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:17.50,0:01:22.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}But say we wanna add another level to an existing project that we got, say in the sample project.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:23.24,0:01:24.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So, to do that,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.06,0:01:27.80,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}let's go ahead and close this,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.22,0:01:33.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and we're gonna target the GameSDK project specifically in this path,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.90,0:01:35.74,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}open the sample content,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:36.00,0:01:39.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}if we go to content examples, GameSDK,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.54,0:01:41.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}we can see that we have Assets,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:41.84,0:01:43.74,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and then we have Particles and we have Levels.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.26,0:01:47.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So let's go inside of here, because I don't wanna load up everything,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:48.32,0:01:50.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and I'm gonna grab the contentExample
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.76,0:01:53.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and drag that in,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.18,0:01:57.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and I'm gonna that the particles and drag that in.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.72,0:02:03.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So now we're ready to fire up the launcher, because we've put everything into our project.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:03.16,0:02:05.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}If we just click here,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:07.64,0:02:10.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}now we have the engine open, and click down here.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:11.12,0:02:13.68,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}Since it's ready, I also I think I click twice,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.84,0:02:16.98,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}so we can remove that, doesn't matter if you open another instance thought.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:17.72,0:02:21.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}To File->Open->contentExample,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.80,0:02:24.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}we're gonna look specifically for the PARTICLE_CONTENT_EXAMPLE.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:25.04,0:02:26.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So if I double click this,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.32,0:02:29.36,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}it'll load the file with the level.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:38.06,0:02:43.66,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}And then when it happened, we can see that we have all of the particles lined up to be ready to be used,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.24,0:02:51.02,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and they all have a name, say 3d rotation, volume, and pretty much, you can go and explore these
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.42,0:02:55.86,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}with the PARTICLE_CONTENT_EXAMPLE. To access the actual particle editor,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:56.08,0:02:59.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}you wanna go to Tools->Particle Editor,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.24,0:03:02.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and it will automatically load the particles over here.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.74,0:03:05.42,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}And you can choose anything, like 3d rotation,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.90,0:03:10.08,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}just right here, and hit this for a second,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.88,0:03:14.64,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}move that over there,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:16.64,0:03:19.32,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}bring this up, scroll up a little bit,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:19.88,0:03:25.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and we can see this is the actual chain, it allows for the 3d rotation to work.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.58,0:03:28.60,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}Bring it up a little closer,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:31.32,0:03:34.64,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and now we can see exactly what it looks like in the editor,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.64,0:03:37.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}we can see what it looks like in the graphic editor for the particles.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:37.72,0:03:40.10,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}And I hope you can explore this projects and
Dialogue: 0,0:03:40.24,0:03:42.94,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}get them up and running for your own development, because
Dialogue: 0,0:03:43.10,0:03:50.08,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}particle effects 2 for our DX12 branch has been a great boost compare to the old particle system,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.32,0:03:52.04,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and I think everybody's gonna like it.
Dialogue: 3,0:03:52.10,0:03:52.46,CHS,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)} 翻译：他出院了
