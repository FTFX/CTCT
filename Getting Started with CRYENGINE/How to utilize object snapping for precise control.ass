Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.80,0:03:07.10,ENG,,0,0,0,,We're gonna deactivate it, and now we're gonna go to the grid snapping section,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:07.33,0:03:11.33,CHS,,0,0,0,,这是挺大的盒子 因为大小单位是米
Dialogue: 2,0:03:07.33,0:03:11.33,ENG,,0,0,0,,which is quite larger, I mean this box is for this based on meters,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:11.34,0:03:13.62,CHS,,0,0,0,,所以这是4米单位
Dialogue: 2,0:03:11.34,0:03:13.62,ENG,,0,0,0,,so that mean it's 4 meters in units.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:13.63,0:03:15.92,CHS,,0,0,0,,而这是2米 这是1米
Dialogue: 2,0:03:13.63,0:03:15.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,This one's 2, this one's 1,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:15.92,0:03:17.92,CHS,,0,0,0,,显然这是0.5米
Dialogue: 2,0:03:15.92,0:03:17.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,and then obviously that's 0.5.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:18.17,0:03:22.26,CHS,,0,0,0,,而我们想要以远处的这种方式叠放
Dialogue: 2,0:03:18.17,0:03:22.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,So in the distance we can see that we wanna stack them in this variety,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:22.26,0:03:26.14,CHS,,0,0,0,,我们可以用网格捕捉来做
Dialogue: 2,0:03:22.26,0:03:26.14,ENG,,0,0,0,,and we can use grid snapping in order to do so.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:27.21,0:03:29.52,CHS,,0,0,0,,先把这个盒子往后移
Dialogue: 2,0:03:27.21,0:03:29.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,So let's first move this box back,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:30.33,0:03:32.52,CHS,,0,0,0,,我们选择距离增量
Dialogue: 2,0:03:30.33,0:03:32.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,we're gonna select the meter increments,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:32.72,0:03:34.18,CHS,,0,0,0,,确保是1
Dialogue: 2,0:03:32.72,0:03:34.18,ENG,,0,0,0,,make sure it's 1,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:34.58,0:03:37.82,CHS,,0,0,0,,再点下图标来激活它
Dialogue: 2,0:03:34.58,0:03:37.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,activate with the actual left mouse button clicked
Dialogue: 1,0:03:37.82,0:03:40.28,CHS,,0,0,0,,可以看见现在有了距离网格
Dialogue: 2,0:03:37.82,0:03:40.28,ENG,,0,0,0,,and we can see that we now have a meter grid up.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:40.69,0:03:46.45,CHS,,0,0,0,,把这个往后移 让它保持在平台上
Dialogue: 2,0:03:40.69,0:03:46.45,ENG,,0,0,0,,And let's move this to the back here, so we can have it on the same platform
Dialogue: 1,0:03:46.64,0:03:48.80,CHS,,0,0,0,,再移一点点
Dialogue: 2,0:03:46.64,0:03:48.80,ENG,,0,0,0,,for maybe a little bit over.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:50.72,0:03:53.20,CHS,,0,0,0,,我把距离增量降低到0.5
Dialogue: 2,0:03:50.72,0:03:53.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,I'm gonna shrink it down to actually 0.5,
Dialogue: 1,0:03:53.56,0:03:55.86,CHS,,0,0,0,,这样就能尽可能的压缩空间
Dialogue: 2,0:03:53.56,0:03:55.86,ENG,,0,0,0,,so we can scoot it back and have the most area.
Dialogue: 1,0:03:59.24,0:04:02.54,CHS,,0,0,0,,这样就放进角落 这也是我想要的效果
Dialogue: 2,0:03:59.24,0:04:02.54,ENG,,0,0,0,,So now we kind of have in the corner back here which is exactly what we want.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:03.40,0:04:05.48,CHS,,0,0,0,,让我们回到
Dialogue: 2,0:04:03.40,0:04:05.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,So let's go back to
Dialogue: 1,0:04:06.09,0:04:09.72,CHS,,0,0,0,,2号盒子 往下移动
Dialogue: 2,0:04:06.09,0:04:09.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,our number 2, and move this downward,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:09.72,0:04:12.33,CHS,,0,0,0,,因为我们要把它放在角落里
Dialogue: 2,0:04:09.72,0:04:12.33,ENG,,0,0,0,,because we need to get it over in the corner as well.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:13.13,0:04:14.57,CHS,,0,0,0,,移过去
Dialogue: 2,0:04:13.13,0:04:14.57,ENG,,0,0,0,,So we move it over,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:18.40,0:04:20.12,CHS,,0,0,0,,然后往前移
Dialogue: 2,0:04:18.40,0:04:20.12,ENG,,0,0,0,,then we move it forward.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:21.65,0:04:24.14,CHS,,0,0,0,,现在2个盒子就位了
Dialogue: 2,0:04:21.65,0:04:24.14,ENG,,0,0,0,,We now have 2 boxes in position.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:24.80,0:04:28.93,CHS,,0,0,0,,选中1米的盒子往下移
Dialogue: 2,0:04:24.80,0:04:28.93,ENG,,0,0,0,,So let's select the one meter box and drag it downward,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:31.14,0:04:33.40,CHS,,0,0,0,,这个应该能恰好贴合
Dialogue: 2,0:04:31.14,0:04:33.40,ENG,,0,0,0,,this should fit just quite snug.
Dialogue: 1,0:04:38.20,0:04:41.15,CHS,,0,0,0,,最后 选中0.5米的盒子
Dialogue: 2,0:04:38.20,0:04:41.15,ENG,,0,0,0,,And lastly, we want to pick the 0.5 meter box,
Dialogue: 1,0:04:41.15,0:04:43.99,CHS,,0,0,0,,跟距离增量一样 都是0.5米
Dialogue: 2,0:04:41.15,0:04:43.99,ENG,,0,0,0,,which is same increment that we have.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:00.53,0:05:02.67,CHS,,0,0,0,,我感觉有点偏了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:00.53,0:05:02.67,ENG,,0,0,0,,And I actually think this is off slightly,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:02.67,0:05:07.03,CHS,,0,0,0,,所以我移动下盒子 以确定贴合的没问题
Dialogue: 2,0:05:02.67,0:05:07.03,ENG,,0,0,0,,so I'm gonna select a box and make sure snapping properly.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:09.35,0:05:11.44,CHS,,0,0,0,,看起来没有问题了
Dialogue: 2,0:05:09.35,0:05:11.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,And it seems to be right in place.
Dialogue: 1,0:05:12.44,0:05:15.58,CHS,,0,0,0,,这样我们就复现了同样的效果
Dialogue: 2,0:05:12.44,0:05:15.58,ENG,,0,0,0,,So now we've replicated the same meter setup,
Dialogue: 1,0:05:16.05,0:05:20.99,CHS,,0,0,0,,包括本集里的网格捕捉 角度捕捉
Dialogue: 2,0:05:16.05,0:05:20.99,ENG,,0,0,0,,inside of this lesson that shows here, here with angular
