Dialogue: 2,0:00:01.02,0:00:05.90,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}For this lession, we're going to talk about how to customize your UI inside of CRYENGINE.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:06.54,0:00:09.70,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}By default, this is the UI that most people see.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:10.00,0:00:12.35,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We actually should step back and...
Dialogue: 2,0:00:12.36,0:00:15.74,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}these icons are the first thing that you would see in the creates objects tab.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:16.00,0:00:21.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We have Properties, Terrain Editor, the typical Perspective and Layer or Level Explorer,
Dialogue: 2,0:00:21.94,0:00:26.26,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}we have a Console, and then up here we have the Tool Bar and Menu.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:27.18,0:00:31.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So, maybe you just happen to remove everything.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:31.16,0:00:38.72,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}so let's go ahead and close out the Properties, Console, the Level Explorer,
Dialogue: 2,0:00:38.84,0:00:44.84,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and now the one thing that seems to be catching up a lot of people is I can close the Perspective viewport.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:45.16,0:00:52.52,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So now we have the most clean, unadulterated version of CRYENGINE interface you can have.
Dialogue: 2,0:00:53.70,0:00:57.94,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}In order to get things back, you're gonna need to go to the Tools pane
Dialogue: 2,0:00:58.16,0:01:02.96,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}which inside of here we can start with the Viewport->Perspective.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:03.16,0:01:05.74,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}This bring us back the viewport that we had before,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:05.96,0:01:10.04,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and if we move it around, we can see that we kind of get a hotbox in the middle.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:10.22,0:01:13.20,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We know that we want this to be right in the center,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:13.21,0:01:17.90,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}so if we go and hover right over this tab, we can just bring it right back.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:18.86,0:01:24.64,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}The same could be set for the actual Level Editor, and let's do the Properties next.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:25.10,0:01:27.88,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So if I drag this over to the right,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:29.12,0:01:33.36,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}I'm able to add it to this pane without disturbing the menu.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:34.78,0:01:39.50,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}I'm gonna do the same for the Create Object tab,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:39.92,0:01:43.22,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and like before, add it this way.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:45.44,0:01:50.70,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}And then finally, to get it all back, we're gonna go to the Level Explorer,
Dialogue: 2,0:01:50.90,0:01:54.48,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}in this time, we're actually going to add it on the bottom.
Dialogue: 2,0:01:55.22,0:02:00.30,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So now we pretty much got back our default setting, we don't have Terrain Editor, but...
Dialogue: 2,0:02:00.52,0:02:05.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}overall, this is the same layout that typically you would start with.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:06.66,0:02:10.34,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So let's go ahead and go up to Layout, we can see that we can save this layout.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:10.74,0:02:15.38,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So just to go a little crazy and just understand maybe, what we're doing.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:15.56,0:02:18.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}Let's move this out and we will save this layout
Dialogue: 2,0:02:18.72,0:02:25.84,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}inside of Crytek and we'll call this one layoutTutorial
Dialogue: 2,0:02:30.70,0:02:32.08,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and we'll export that.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:32.54,0:02:35.38,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}Now appear, let's go ahead and reset the layout.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:35.82,0:02:38.32,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We're just come back to this default thing,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:38.50,0:02:41.06,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}let's go ahead and close everything once again,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:42.76,0:02:45.10,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}so then we're left with our default,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:45.50,0:02:49.32,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We're gonna go ahead and load our layoutTutorial.json file.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:49.64,0:02:51.86,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We will import that, and you notice that,
Dialogue: 2,0:02:52.04,0:02:56.08,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}it's come back and allows you to do all the customization like before.
Dialogue: 2,0:02:58.12,0:03:03.74,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}The next thing that we can do is actually come up to the Toolbar, so in this blank area,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:03.88,0:03:09.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}if we right click, we can see that we have a lot of bottoms that aren't exactly exposed by default.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:09.70,0:03:14.82,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}We click the Audio, now we have a bunch of audio bottoms, we also have Constraints.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:14.83,0:03:18.84,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}And you'll see that we have this little dot next each one of them,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:19.04,0:03:23.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and you can actually move it around, it's very very portable to wherever you want.
Dialogue: 2,0:03:28.92,0:03:34.92,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}So, this is basic understanding of how you can manipulate just the toolbar and then also
Dialogue: 2,0:03:35.18,0:03:38.56,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}the entire viewport and maybe how you can reset it and load
Dialogue: 2,0:03:38.82,0:03:43.44,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}or just even save your viewport that you like with the layout you want,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:44.42,0:03:48.16,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and in future ones, we'll go over the console variables,
Dialogue: 2,0:03:48.16,0:03:51.76,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}and look at how we can customize commands or even macros
Dialogue: 2,0:03:51.76,0:03:55.70,ENG,,0,0,0,,{\fad(50,50)}to be able to give us a more customized and streamlined workflow.
